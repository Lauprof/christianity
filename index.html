      color: red;">T</span>oday is a good day where we get to experience the madness exhibited by humans.
       A day in which we get to interrogate the many beliefs held upon by humans over centuries.
       About two billion of them are saying christ has risen but none can authoritatively show christ rising up it is all beliefs.
       Mentally disabled people hear voices see things which in reality they aren't there.They are very convinced that those things exists . What's the difference between those ill people and the religious fanatics?.
       In my view there is no so much difference between these two kind of people.The only difference is that one party calls it faith while the other is termed ill ,sick etc.
       But the bottom line is none of these two people can prove empirically about their delusions.
       I cannot simply follow beliefs unquestionably like a sheep,this is an insult to my intelligent per say .It is good to question and interrogate things so as to understand them better but when you applauded for not questioning things there lies lot of hidden agenda.

      <p>THE DEVIL</p>
     <span style ="text-indent: 4px;
     font-size: xx-large;
     color: red;">W</span>e are left with questions wondering who is right and wrong? Should we believe in what we can see or accept there are things beyond our understanding?
      If so how can the same humans claim to understand what they say is impossible to comprehend?This is a contradiction.
      
      Am i to believe that when bad things befall me ,satan is the cause?Why can't Yahweh finish the devil once for all?Why the world wide flood all for nothing?No eradication of evil as was intended?
      Is God very weak and unintelligent that he didn't know the solution was to squash the Satan since he is said to be the cause of all evil?.
      Out of the 500 + planets we have discovered God couldn't send the devil to a planet without humans?We as humans we very weak against the devil yet we expected to emerge victorious? Didn't the japanese surrender after the atomic bombs were dropped,how do you defend yourself from a more powerful enemy?
      I also ask myself will the devil really torment those who went against his enemy?It does not make sense to me,it seems the devil will congratulate you.
      
      The writers of the bible had little knowledge about the cosmos and that's why they didn't think of making satan fall into a different world like Jupiter .This book is just an ordinary one full of mediocrity and fantasy but here we forced to believe it unquestionably.
