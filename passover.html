<p> Passover </p>
Passover is a significant Jewish holiday that commemorates the liberation of the Israelites from slavery in ancient Egypt. The holiday lasts for seven or eight days, depending on the Jewish tradition, and is celebrated in the springtime, usually in March or April. Passover is a time for Jewish people to come together to remember the events of the Exodus, when Moses led the Israelites out of Egypt and towards the Promised Land.

The story of Passover is told in the book of Exodus in the Hebrew Bible. According to the story, the Israelites were enslaved in Egypt and suffered under the cruel rule of Pharaoh. Moses was chosen by God to lead the Israelites out of Egypt, and after a series of plagues, Pharaoh finally agreed to let the Israelites go. The Israelites were instructed to mark their doors with the blood of a lamb so that the Angel of Death would pass over their homes, sparing their firstborn sons from death. This event is known as the Passover, and it is celebrated each year in remembrance of the Israelites' freedom from slavery.

Passover is celebrated with a special meal called the Seder, which means "order" in Hebrew. The Seder is held on the first two nights of Passover and is a time for family and friends to come together to retell the story of the Exodus. The meal is filled with symbolic foods, such as matzah (unleavened bread), bitter herbs, and charoset (a mixture of fruits and nuts), each of which has a special meaning related to the story of Passover. The Seder also includes the reading of the Haggadah, a special prayer book that recounts the story of the Exodus and explains the meaning of the various symbolic foods.

In addition to the Seder, Passover is also a time for Jewish people to reflect on the meaning of freedom and liberation. The holiday is a reminder of the importance of standing up for justice and opposing oppression, and it encourages Jews to work towards a world in which all people are free from slavery and injustice.

Passover is one of the most important Jewish holidays, and it is celebrated with joy and reverence around the world. It is a time for Jewish people to come together to remember their shared history and to celebrate the power of freedom and liberation. The story of Passover is a reminder of the strength and resilience of the Jewish people, and it continues to inspire Jews to this day to fight for justice and freedom for all people.
