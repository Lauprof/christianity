  <p>Yahweh the sky god</p>

Yahweh is not typically referred to as a sky god. In the Abrahamic religions (Judaism, Christianity, and Islam), Yahweh is the God of the Hebrews and is seen as the creator and ruler of the universe. While the concept of Yahweh has evolved over time, he is generally seen as a divine being who is omnipotent, omniscient, and all-loving.

In Judaism, Yahweh is the one true God and is worshipped as the creator of the universe and the giver of the Torah, the holy book of the Jewish people. The name Yahweh is considered so holy that it is often not spoken aloud and is instead replaced with the word "Adonai," meaning "Lord." Yahweh is also seen as a God of justice and mercy, who rewards those who follow his commandments and punishes those who disobey.

In Christianity, Yahweh is known as God the Father and is seen as the creator of the universe and the father of Jesus Christ. Christians believe that Yahweh is a loving God who desires a personal relationship with his followers, and that through faith in Jesus Christ, they can have eternal life.

In Islam, Yahweh is known as Allah and is seen as the one true God who created the universe and sent the prophet Muhammad to guide humanity. Muslims believe that Allah is compassionate and merciful, and that by following the teachings of the Quran, they can live a righteous life and attain salvation.

While Yahweh is not typically associated with the sky in these religions, there are certainly many depictions of God in the sky or heavens. For example, in the book of Genesis in the Bible, Yahweh creates the heavens and the earth, and throughout the Bible there are many references to God's power and majesty being reflected in the sky and celestial bodies.

Overall, Yahweh is seen as a powerful and loving God in the Abrahamic religions, and is worshipped and revered by millions of people around the world.
